# Code Preview Feature - Testing Guide

## Overview
The chat mode now includes a **code preview container** similar to Cursor's interface. When the AI responds with code, it appears in a collapsible preview before the user clicks "Insert Code".

## Features

### 1. Code Preview Container
- Shows the first 8 lines of code by default
- Displays total line count if code is longer than 8 lines
- Clean, professional styling with syntax highlighting

### 2. Expandable Code View
- Click "Show X more lines" to expand and see full code
- Click "Show less" to collapse back to preview
- Smooth transitions and intuitive chevron indicators

### 3. Insert Code Button
- Individual "Insert Code" button for each message containing code
- Inserts at current cursor position in the editor
- Maintains proper indentation and formatting

## How to Test

1. **Open the main application** (`index.html`)
2. **Switch to Chat mode** in the AI panel
3. **Ask for code examples**, such as:
   - "Create a simple HTML form with CSS styling"
   - "Write a JavaScript function to validate email addresses"
   - "Show me a CSS grid layout example"

4. **Observe the response**:
   - AI response text appears normally
   - Code preview container shows below the text
   - Preview shows first 8 lines with expand option if longer
   - "Insert Code" button appears at the bottom

5. **Test the expand/collapse**:
   - Click "Show X more lines" to expand
   - Click "Show less" to collapse
   - Verify smooth animations

6. **Test code insertion**:
   - Position cursor in the editor where you want code
   - Click "Insert Code" button
   - Verify code is inserted at cursor position
   - Verify editor receives focus after insertion

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Preview before insert**: Users can see what code will be added
- **Cursor positioning**: Users can position cursor correctly before inserting
- **Individual control**: Each message has its own insert button
- **Professional appearance**: Matches modern IDE interfaces

### Developer Experience
- **Modular design**: Code preview is separate from message content
- **Backward compatibility**: Existing functionality remains intact
- **Extensible**: Easy to add features like copy-to-clipboard, syntax highlighting

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components
- `addMessageToHistory()` - Enhanced to store code blocks
- `renderMessage()` - Generates preview containers
- `insertCodeFromMessage()` - Handles insertion from specific messages
- CSS styles in `chat-panel-clean.css` for visual presentation

### Code Structure
```javascript
// Message structure now includes codeBlock
{
    role: 'assistant',
    content: 'AI response text...',
    codeBlock: 'extracted code...',
    timestamp: '2025-06-16T...'
}
```

This enhancement significantly improves the user experience by providing visual feedback and precise control over code insertion, similar to professional IDE tools like Cursor.
