All notable changes to the LiveEditorClaude project will be documented in this file.

## [0.6.0] - 2025-06-16

### Major Architecture Refactor ✨

  - `LintManager.js` - Real-time linting and error detection
  - `FormattingManager.js` - Code formatting capabilities
  - `KeyboardManager.js` - Keyboard shortcuts and commands
  - `Editor-New.js` - Core editor with clean initialization
- **Enhanced**: FileManager now creates default files automatically
- **Fixed**: All keyboard shortcuts now working properly (Ctrl+F, Ctrl+H, etc.)
- **Improved**: Better error handling and initialization order
- **Professional**: Maintainable, testable, and extensible codebase

### Restored & Enhanced Features
- ✅ **File Tabs**: Now displaying properly with default HTML file
- ✅ **Search/Replace**: Advanced find and replace with match highlighting
- ✅ **Real-time Linting**: Error detection for JavaScript, CSS, HTML, JSON
