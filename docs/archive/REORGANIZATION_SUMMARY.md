## 📖 Index Files Created

### Main Index
- **`docs/README.md`** - Master documentation index with quick links to all sections

### Directory Indexes
- **`docs/plans/README.md`** - Active plans overview and usage guide
- **`docs/guides/README.md`** - Guides categorized by purpose with quick reference
- **`docs/archive/README.md`** - Completed features timeline and learning notes

---

## 🎨 Documentation Principles

### When to Use Each Directory

**`/plans`** - Active Development
- Current roadmaps and TODO lists
- Implementation plans in progress
- Future feature specifications
- Work-in-progress documentation

**`/guides`** - Reference & How-To
- Setup instructions (environment, database, deployment)
- Development guidelines (coding standards, workflows)
- Usage documentation (features, tools)
- Evergreen reference material

**`/archive`** - Historical Records
- Completed implementations (with dates)
- Deprecated plans (with reasons)
- Session summaries and logs
- Legacy documentation for reference

---

## 📝 Workflow

### Adding New Documentation

1. **New Feature Plan**
   - Create in `/plans`
   - Add to `plans/README.md`
   - Link from main `docs/README.md`

2. **New Guide**
   - Create in `/guides`
   - Categorize appropriately
   - Add to `guides/README.md`
   - Update main index

3. **Feature Completed**
   - Move from `/plans` to `/archive`
   - Add ✅ and completion date
   - Update both README files
   - Document lessons learned

### Moving Documents

```bash
# Moving to archive (feature completed)
Move-Item -Path "docs/plans/FEATURE.md" -Destination "docs/archive/"

# Update the file with completion date and status
# Update both README.md files
```
