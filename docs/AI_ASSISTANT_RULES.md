# AI Assistant Development Reminder

## ðŸ¤– AI Assistant Rules for LiveEditorClaude Development

### Before Every Response:
1. **Check TODO.md** - Always reference the current phase and priority items
2. **Verify Phase** - Currently in Phase 1: Enhanced Editor Experience
3. **Review Recent Changes** - Check changelog.md for context of recent work

### During Development:
1. **One TODO Item Focus** - Work on one specific TODO item at a time
2. **Test Immediately** - Test every change before proceeding
3. **Document Changes** - Update changelog.md for significant changes
4. **Mark Completion** - Change `[ ]` to `[x]` in TODO.md when items are done

### Code Standards:
- Follow existing code patterns and structure
- Maintain dark/light theme compatibility
- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add proper error handling

### Changelog Requirements:
- Document all user-facing changes
- Include technical improvements
- Reference completed TODO items
- Use semantic versioning
- Follow CHANGELOG_FORMAT.md guidelines

### Phase 1 Priorities (Current):
1. Enhanced CodeMirror Setup
2. Find & Replace System  
3. Code Quality Features
4. Editor Enhancements
5. Improved File Management

### Quality Gates:
- [ ] TODO item consulted and referenced
- [ ] Change tested in browser
- [ ] Existing functionality verified unbroken
- [ ] Changelog updated (if significant change)
- [ ] TODO marked complete (if applicable)
- [ ] Code follows project patterns

### Communication:
- Always mention which TODO item you're working on
- Explain how changes fit into the overall plan
- Highlight when phase goals are completed
- Suggest next logical steps

### Files to Monitor:
- `TODO.md` - Development roadmap
- `changelog.md` - Change history
- `DEVELOPMENT_RULES.md` - Process guidelines
- `CHANGELOG_FORMAT.md` - Documentation standards

### Emergency Protocols:
- If TODO.md seems out of sync, ask for clarification
- If uncertain about phase priorities, confirm with user
- If breaking changes needed, discuss impact first
- If TODO items seem too large, suggest breaking them down

**Remember: We're building a Cursor-like AI-powered editor. Every change should move us closer to that goal while maintaining quality and following our established process.**
