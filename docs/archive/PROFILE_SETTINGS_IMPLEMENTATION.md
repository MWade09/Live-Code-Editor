## ☁️ Supabase Storage Setup

### Required: Create Storage Bucket

The avatar upload feature requires a Supabase Storage bucket named `user-uploads`.

**To set up in Supabase Dashboard**:

1. Navigate to **Storage** in your Supabase project
2. Click **Create Bucket**
3. Bucket name: `user-uploads`
4. Set to **Public** (so avatars are accessible via URL)
5. Click **Create Bucket**

**Folder Structure**:
```
user-uploads/
  └── avatars/
      ├── {userId}-{timestamp}.jpg
      ├── {userId}-{timestamp}.png
      └── ...
```

**Storage Policies Needed**:

```sql
-- Allow users to upload their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND
  (storage.foldername(name))[1] = 'avatars' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]::text
);

-- Allow users to update their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]::text
);

-- Allow users to delete their own avatars
CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own avatars"
ON storage.objects FOR DELETE
TO authenticated
USING (
  bucket_id = 'user-uploads' AND
  auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[2]::text
);

-- Allow everyone to read avatars (public access)
CREATE POLICY "Avatars are publicly accessible"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
TO public
USING (bucket_id = 'user-uploads');
```

**Or via Supabase Dashboard**:
1. Go to Storage → user-uploads → Policies
2. Create policy for INSERT (authenticated users only)
3. Create policy for SELECT (public access)
4. Create policy for UPDATE (owner only)
5. Create policy for DELETE (owner only)

## 🐛 Known Issues / Edge Cases

### Potential Issues:

1. **Supabase Storage Bucket**
   - Must create `user-uploads` bucket manually
   - Must set bucket to public
   - Storage policies must be configured
   - **Action**: Add setup instructions to docs ✅

2. **Avatar Upload**
   - Large files may take time to upload
   - No progress bar (could add)
   - No image cropping (uploads as-is)
   - **Consideration**: Add Cloudinary or ImageKit for optimization

3. **Password Change**
   - "Last updated: Never" is hardcoded
   - Could track password_last_changed_at in database
   - **Future**: Add password history to prevent reuse

4. **Delete Account**
   - No grace period or account recovery
   - Immediate and permanent
   - **Future**: Add 30-day soft delete period

5. **Data Export**
   - Currently just a placeholder
   - Need to implement GDPR-compliant export
   - **TODO**: Generate JSON/ZIP of user data

6. **Tag Input**
   - Max tags limits are frontend-only
   - Database allows unlimited array entries
   - **Fine for now**: Backend can enforce if needed
